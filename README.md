# AWSAP-Notes

These are personal notes that I am taking as I work my way through A Cloud Guru's AWS Architect Pro course. 

Please note that I cannot certify that these notes are 100% correct as things change quite rapidly in the cloud world. They are simply my notes as I learned things.

## The Exam

All of AWS' test questions are based on [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy). As this is a professional exam (not associate), the expectation is that the student will be in phase two of the taxonomy where you analyze/apply/evaluate the content domain. 

**NOTE:** Some of the questions on the exam are beta questions which will not be scored against you. 

**NOTE:** AWS' documentation states that a technology should be GA for about 6 months before they will consider having it on their exams. This means that most brand new tech will not be featured. 

**NOTE:** Make sure to read all of the supplemental material as it fills gaps in the required information that is not covered in the course. 

I will link all white papers I find below for later reading:
